Summary: welcome back

it has been a while.

clearly, I am not that good with the whole "blog something" thing, so why bother?

also: opening a blog when the form is clearly dying? no thing like the hipster thing.

at the end of the day, I much prefer the distilled writing form of [twitter](https://twitter.com/ebassi) to the verbosity
of a full blog; on the other hand, I still have a [tumblr](http://tumblr.emmanuelebassi.name) for the stuff that requires
images, links, and text. I think I could make the blog work for the slightly longer essays, the ones that do not fit in
the narrow margins of twitter, and do not interest the tumblr crowd. maybe the occasional quote, the random inside joke,
the clever *mot juste*.

so, I guess the idea is: welcome back.
