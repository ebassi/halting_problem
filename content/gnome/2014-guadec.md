like [many fellow GNOME developers][guadec-participants] I will be in
Strasbourg for [GUADEC 2014][guadec-web].

on Monday morning, I will give a talk on the [GTK+ Scene Graph Tool
Kit][gsk-talk], or GSK for short, but you should make sure to attend the
[many interesting talks][guadec-schedule] that we have planned for you this
year.

see you at GUADEC!
