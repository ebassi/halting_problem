Summary: The Endless Kickstarter campaign achieved its goal in 4 days

Right at the moment I'm writing this blog post, the
[Endless](https://endlessm.com) [Kickstarter campaign][endless-ks] page
looks like this:

I'm incredibly humbled and proud. Thank you all **so much** for your support
and your help in bringing Endless to the world.

The campaign goes on, though; we added various new perks, including:

  * the option to donate an Endless computer to [Habitat for Humanity][h4h]
  or [Funsepa][funsepa], two charities that are involved in housing and
  education projects in developing countries
  * the full package â€” computer, carabiner, mug, and t-shirt; this one ships
  everywhere in the world, while we're still working out the kinks of
  international delivery of the merch

Again, thank you all for your support.
