Summary: in which I talk about taking the old lady out for a spin
Abstract: Development blogs definitely have a place in the continuum of interactions between project maintainers and their users; and if your project does not have a blog already, or has a languishing one with no updates in weeks/months/years, then you should take some time to build it and add some (regularly scheduled) content for it

The GTK+ project has [a development blog][gtk-blog].

I know it may come as a shock to many of you, and you'd be completely
justified in thinking that I just made that link up — but the truth is, the
GTK+ project has had a development blog for a long while.

Sadly, the blog hasn't been updated in five years — mostly around the time
3.0 was released, and the [GTK+ website][gtk-web] was revamped; even before
that, the blog was mostly used for release announcements, which do not make
for very interesting content.

Like many free and open source software projects, GTK+ has various venues of
interaction between its contributors and its users; mailing lists, personal
blogs, IRC, Stack Overflow, reddit, and many, many other channels. In this
continuum of discussions it's both easy to get lost and to lose the sense of
having said things before — after all, if I repeat something at least three
times a week on three different websites for three years, how can people
still not know about it? Some users will always look at catching up after
three years, because their projects live on very different schedules that
the GTK releases one; others will try to look for official channels, even if
the free and open source software landscape has fragmented to such a degree
that any venue can be made "official" by the simple fact of having a
contributor on it; others again will look at the API reference for any
source of truth, forgetting, possibly, that if everything went into the API
reference then it would cease to be useful as a reference.

The GTK+ development blog is not meant to be the only source for truth, or
the only "official" channel; it's meant to be a place for interesting
content regarding the project, for developers using GTK+ or considering to
use it; a place that acts as a hub to let interested people discover what's
up with GTK+ itself but that don't want to subscribe to the commits list or
join IRC.

From an editorial standpoint, I'd like the GTK+ development blog to be open
to contribution from people contributing to GTK+; using GTK+; and newcomers
to the GTK+ code base and their experiences. What's a cool GTK+ feature that
you worked on? How did GTK+ help you in writing your application or
environment? How did you find contributing to GTK+ for the first time? If
you want to write an article for the GTK+ blog talking about this, then feel
free to reach out to me with an outline, and I'll be happy to help you.

In the meantime, the [first post][gtk-twig-web] in the *This Week in GTK+*
series has gone up; you'll get a new post about it every Monday, and if you
want to raise awareness on something that happened during a week, feel free
to point it out on [the wiki][gtk-twig-wiki].
