Summary: a recap of the contributions to the GTK+ 3.22 development cycle

I've just posted on the [GTK+ development blog][gtk-dev-blog] the latest
article in the "who writes GTK+" series. Now that we have a proper
development blog, this is the kind of content that should be present there
instead of my personal blog.

If you're not following the GTK+ development blog, you really should do so
*now*. Additionally, you should follow [@GTKToolkit][gtk-twitter] on Twitter
and, if you're into niche social platforms, a kernel developer, or a Linus
groupie, there's the [GTK+][gtk-gplus] page on Google Plus.

Additionally, if you're contributing to GTK+, or using it, you should
consider writing an article for the developers blog; just contact me on IRC
(I'm `ebassi` on irc.gnome.org) or send me an email if you have an idea
about something you worked on, a new feature, some new API, or the internals
of the platform.
