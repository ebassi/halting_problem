Summary: An anniversary and an announcement

I've been working at [Endless](https://endlessm.com) for two years, now.

I'm incredibly lucky to be working at a great company, with great
colleagues, on cool projects, using technologies I love, towards a goal I
care deeply about.

We've been operating a bit under the radar for a while, but now it's time to
unveil what we've been doing â€” and we're doing it via a [Kickstarter
campaign][endless-ks]:

{% figure {filename}/images/endless-ks.png The computer for the entire world %}

{% figure {filename}/images/endless-ks-2.png The OS for the entire world %}

{% figure {filename}/images/endless-ks-3.png Endless %}

It's been an honour and a privilege working on this little, huge project for
the past two years, and I can't wait to see what another two years are going
to bring us.
