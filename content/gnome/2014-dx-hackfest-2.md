Summary: recap from the second day of the DX hackfest held in Berlin

the second day of the hackfest had a pretty big discussion on the roadmap
for GTK+.

thanks to Matthias Clasen, we had a list of things to discuss prior to the
start of the hackfest, even if Matthias himself would not be present:

  * filling the gaps between the GNOME HIG and the GTK+ API needed to
    implement it
  * a better cross-platform story for tool kit maintainers and application
    developers
  * touch support
  * scene graph to replace Clutter
  * documentation
  * improving the relationship of the tool kit with Glade
  * required clean ups for GTK+ 4

during the afternoon we managed to go through the first bullet point of the
list, but we made really good progress on it, and we managed to assign each
sub-issue to a prospective owner that is going to be in charge of it.

hopefully, weâ€™re going to go through the other points during the rest of the
hackfest much more quickly.
