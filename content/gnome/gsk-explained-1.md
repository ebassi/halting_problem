Title: GSK Explained I â€” A GSK primer
Slug: gsk-explained-1
State: draft
Summary: In which I start explaining what GSK is, does, and where it's at
Abstract: Some people started noticing bits and pieces of GSK landing in the GTK+ repository, mostly in topic branches, so it's probably a good time to explain what I'm doing, how, how long it's going to take, and what it means for everybody else who is waiting for a scene graph API, or is just curious about it
