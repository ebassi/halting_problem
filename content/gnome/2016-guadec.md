Summary: See you all in Karlsruhe

![Speaking at GUADEC 2016]({filename}/images/guadec-2016-speaking-badge.png)

I'm going to talk about [the evolution of GTK+ rendering][gtk-talk], from
its humble origins of X11 graphics contexts, to Cairo, to GSK. If you are
interested in this kind of stuff, you can either attend my presentation on
Saturday at 11 in the Grace Room, or you can just find me and have a chat.

I'm also going to stick around during the BoF days â€” especially for the
usual GTK+ team meeting, which will be on the 15th.

See you all in Karlsruhe.
