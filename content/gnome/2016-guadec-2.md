Summary: And we're backâ€¦

*Writing this from my home office, while drinking the first coffee of the day.*

Once again, GUADEC has come and gone.

Once again, it was impeccably organized by so many wonderful volunteers.

Once again, I feel my batteries recharged.

Once again, I've had so many productive conversations.

Once again, I've had many chances to laugh.

Once again, I've met both new and long since friends.

Once again, I've visited a new city, with interesting life, food, drinks,
and locations.

Once again, thanks to everybody who worked very hard to make this GUADEC
happen and be the success it was.

Once again, we return.
