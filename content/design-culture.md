Title: design culture
Tags: design, free software
Summary: software development, free software, and design should not be at odds with each other

there are days when I just read places like Phoronix[^1] and the `r/linux`
sub-reddit, and I stumble upon great stuff — when I say "stumble upon" I
really mean "they are coming out of the walls", and when I say "great stuff"
I really mean "oh god oh god we're all going to die". I apologize for the
language, but my Twitter feed is rated R by the ESRB.

the obvious point above is that a widely shared viewpoint in the free and
open source software community at large is that "design" means "snazz up the
UI" at best, or, at worst, as Hylke eloquently put:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>two things: design isn’t “dumbing things down” or “stripping features”, and open source isn’t “about choice” or “adding features”.</p>&mdash; Hylke Bons (@hbons) <a href="https://twitter.com/hbons/status/522055765725806593">October 14, 2014</a>

the cognitive dissonance runs even deeper than just not realizing that "form
follows function" is a conscious design choice. go to a conference, and look
at the laptops, and you'll see MacBooks or ThinkPads, which are two or the
most heavily designed pieces of machinery in existence[^2]. even on the
software side, the whole idea of "Unix Philosophy" is the expression of a
certain design culture.

in short: you **cannot** "not care" about design. everything deals with
design, because design deals with everything we do.

obviously, design choices like *[make everything as clean and
distraction-free as possible][gnome]* or *[vomit everything in front of the
user like your GUI is the result of an explosion in a widget factory][kde]*
can either lead to useful user interactions or not, but they **are** design
choices, whether you like them or not.

[^1]: I won't dignify their click-bait policies with a link, I'm sorry.
[^2]: one of the reasons I am not going to buy ThinkPad branded laptops any
  more is that Lenovo decided to re-design their product in a way that does
  not conform to the older industrial design tenets.
