a discussion on [guadec-list][1] about adopting a code of conduct for GUADEC
prompted me to write down some thoughts about the issue.

to be perfectly, honest I never thought an anti-harassment policy would be a
controversial issue *at all* in 2014, after the rate of adoption of codes of
conduct, and of anti-harrasment policies, at convention and conferences all over
the world. there have been high profile cases, and speakers as well as attendees
have finally started to stand up, and publicly state that they won't attend a
convention or a conference (even if sponsored) if the organizers do not put in
place this kind of documents.

GNOME, as a community, was if not the first, one of the first high profile free
software foundations to define and implement a code of conduct. I'll actually
come back to that later, but this is a point of pride for me.

yet, I have to admit that my heart sank a bit for every email in the discussion
on guadec-list, and especially from members of our own community.

as I said, GNOME already has a [code of conduct][2], pitiful and neutered as it
may be, and it applies to every venue of communication we have: mailing list,
IRC, our web servers, and also our *conferences*. to have and implement a code
of conduct is not a per-GUADEC-edition, local-team-only decision to take — and
how do I know that? because it's the board that approved the code of conduct for
the mailing lists, IRC, and web servers, and it was not the moderation team, or
the IRC operators, or the system administrators that took this decision.

I do understand that we like our conferences like we like our software:
free-as-in-speech, and interesting to work on. that does not imply that we
should just assume bad stuff won't happen, or that people will automatically
find the right person to help them because somebody else decided to be a jerk.
to be fair, our software is *full* of well-defined rules for redistribution, and
our conferences should be equally well-defined when it comes to acceptable
behaviour and responsible people to contact. why we do that? because it helps in
having a clear set of rules and people responsible to avoid abuse, *if* that
happens.

I honestly have *zero* patience for the people saying that «everyone can be
offended by something, thus we shouldn't do anything». the usual, trite,
argument is that having an anti-harassment policy will provide a "chilling
effect" on attendees; it should also not be necessary to have these policies,
because we trust our community to be composed of good people, and these policies
automatically assume that everyone will be misbehaving. those are both
ridiculous positions, even if they are sadly fairly common in the free and open
source community at large. they are based on a fairly obvious misunderstanding;
the code of conduct is not a sword for preventing people from misbehaving: it's
a *shield* for people being the object of discrimination and harassment.

I am lucky enough, and privileged enough, that I have not been discriminated for
who I am, what I like, who I like, what I do, or how I do it. others are not in
such position, and they attend GUADEC. we *want* them to attend GUADEC, because
they are our next contributor, our next user, our next tester, our next
designer, our next bugsquad member, our next person submitting a documentation
patch. I don't want them to be placed in a position where they balk at the idea
of participating at GUADEC because they don't feel safe enough, because they
aren't part of our community yet. you want to talk about a chilling effect?
*that* is the chilling effect. I have no concerns for members of our community:
I know that most of them can actually behave like actual human beings in a
social context. that knowledge comes from 10+ years in this community. I don't
expect, and I'd be *foolish* to do so, that new people that have not been at
GUADEC yet, or have been newly introduced to our community, also posses that
knowledge.

a final thought: I actually want a better code of conduct for GNOME's online
services as well, one that is clear on responsibility and consequences, because
our current one is a defanged travesty, which was implemented to be the lowest
common denominator possible. it does not require responsibility for enforcing
it, and it does not provide accountability for actually respecting it. that is a
topic for the new board, one I expect will be handled this year; I'll make sure
to prod those guys. ;-)
