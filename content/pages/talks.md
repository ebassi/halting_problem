Title: Talks
Slug: talks

I ended up talking at various conferences in the past few years because
apparently people think I have something worth to contribute to the
discourse on software engineering, release management, or technology. I am
both shocked and amazed at that.

while I ended up storing copies of the notes or slides all over the place, I
am now trying to keep them all on this site.
