Title: Comments policy
Slug: comments
Status: hidden

As you may have noticed, I don't allow commenting on my blog.

First of all: comments rarely improve a discussion. A constructive dialogue
can be established by two people, or a few more; when opening the floor to
basically everyone on the series of tubes that make the Internet, then
everything can get clogged up fairly fast with crap that I don't want to
even look at, let alone read.

I don't want to use yet another external service to handle comments on my
static website; right now, this site is pretty much free of maintainance
hassles, and I fully intend to keep it that way. I may very well be lazy
(admittedly, I *am* a software engineer) but maintaining my website is not
my job.

Comments are an invaluable source of spam, and once humanity manages to use
internet spam as a sustainable energy form, we will probably be able to
reach the stars; in the meantime, though, it's all entropy and wasted
computer cycles, so I'm not going to play with it.

Finally, this is my website. I write it, manage it, and control it myself.
It's my metaphorical home, and I can invite you in to listen to what I say,
if you are so inclined. I am under no obligation to hear what you think of
what I'm saying, unless I ask you to. You are absolutely free to use your
own little soapbox, just like I am using mine, to shout at me; I'll listen,
if I want to, and maybe even reply, if I feel so inclined.

There are plenty of ways in order to let me know what you think, or how I am
guilty of being wrong on the internet; my [about page](/pages/about-me)
page lists various of those ways.
