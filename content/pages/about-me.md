I'm currently working at [Endless](http://endlessm.com) as a senior software
engineer. I used to work at Intel in the [open source technology
center](https://01.org/), where I worked on the Moblin/MeeGo netbook user
experience team, and in the visualization team, where I worked on developing
and maintaining [Clutter](http://www.clutter-project.org), a free software
library for creating fast, dynamic, and portable user interfaces. before
that, I used to work at OpenedHand, where I worked on projects like the
Nokia N series internet tablets.
