I'm currently working at [Endless](http://endlessm.com) as a senior software
engineer. I used to work at Intel in the [open source technology
center](https://01.org/), on the Moblin/MeeGo netbook user experience team,
where I worked on successful pieces of technology such as the status panel
and the pasteboard panel; and in the visualization team, where I worked on
developing and maintaining [Clutter](http://www.clutter-project.org), a free
software library for creating fast, dynamic, and portable user interfaces.
before that, I used to work at OpenedHand, where I worked on projects like
the Nokia N series internet tablets.

I am a [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org) contributor in the core platform
libraries, working on GLib, [GTK+](http://www.gtk.org), and
[Clutter](http://www.clutter-project.org). I also held the position of
director of the Board of the [GNOME
Foundation](https://foundation.gnome.org) for three years.
