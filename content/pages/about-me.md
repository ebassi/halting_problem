Geek, husband, lover, software developer, londoner.

I'm currently employed at [Endless](http://endlessm.com) as a senior
software engineer, and I work on the applications and SDK team to create a
first class application development platform. I used to work at Intel in the
[open source technology center](https://01.org/), on the Moblin/MeeGo
netbook user experience team, where I worked on successful pieces of
technology such as the IM and social network status panel and the pasteboard
panel; and later in the visualization team, where I worked on developing and
maintaining [Clutter](https://blogs.gnome.org/clutter/), a free software
library for creating fast, dynamic, and portable graphical user interfaces.
Before that, I used to work at OpenedHand, where I worked on projects like
the Nokia N series internet tablets.

I am a free software developer.

I am a [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org) contributor in the core platform
libraries, working on GLib, [GTK+](http://www.gtk.org), and
[Clutter](https://blogs.gnome.org/clutter/). I also held the position of
director of the Board of the [GNOME Foundation](https://gnome.org/foundation)
for three years.

Outside of GNOME, I maintain various free and open source software projects,
like [Graphene](https://ebassi.github.com/graphene), a small library of fast
mathematical types for 3D canvases; [Emeus](https://ebassi.github.com/emeus),
a constraint-based layout manager for GTK+ applications using the Cassowary
constraint solving algorithm; and [libepoxy](https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy),
a small library that takes care of loading and function dispatching for OpenGL
and OpenGL ES on various platforms.
