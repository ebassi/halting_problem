Slug: projects

These are some of the projects I maintain:

 * [Graphene][graphene] — a library of types useful to write 2D and 3D
   drawing code
 * [Epoxy][epoxy] — a wrapper library that makes it easier to write
   portable OpenGL
 * [Emeus][emeus] — a constraint-based layout manager similar to
   Apple's AutoLayout for GTK 3.x
 * [taglib-rs][taglib-rust] — Rust bindings for taglib
